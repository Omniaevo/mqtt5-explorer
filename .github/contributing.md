# Welcome MQTT5 Explorer contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](../README.md).

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with MQTT5 Explorer app, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/Omniaevo/mqtt5-explorer/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/Omniaevo/mqtt5-explorer/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Omniaevo/mqtt5-explorer/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone except our team members. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/it/) (we are currently using **Node.js v14**).

2. [Install Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html).

3. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.
Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.

- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.

Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.

- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

### Your PR is merged
